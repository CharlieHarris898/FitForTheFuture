- Make the stock and keep it hot.

- Melt butter and fry the onion and garlic for a couple of minutes. Then add the mushrooms (and any other veg you want to use - courgette and spinach work well). Fry on moderate heat for 5 minutes.

- Add the couscous, about 3 tablespoons per person, and mix with the onions, garlic and mushrooms.

- Add the stock, one ladleful at a time. Add the next ladleful when it is all absorbed by the couscous. Keep stirring. After about 10 minutes the couscous will not want to absorb any more so reduce the final ladleful to the desired consistency - it should look creamy. Serve and enjoy!
